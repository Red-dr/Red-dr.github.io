          <h5>Current Project</h5>
          <li>
            <p>This project is currently suspended as I discovered that my skills and knowledge is not up to the level I would 
              like to get this to a level I am happy with. I am currently working on getting those skills developed to come back to this project.
              
              I have called it Darknight. It uses Box2D for the in-world physics,
              as well as Fmod for the sound and SDL for rendering. Around every sprite is a box that handles the collision
              between the objects. This is in the world of Box2D, which also controls the gravity and the movement of the
              sprites. The player sprite moves by using ApplyLinearImpulse(). The enemies (the guys in red) have no AI and
              the collision between the player and the enemies do not register an event. Currently, there is no player sprite
              moving right for an attack, movement and jumping. The attack animation currently spawns a box2d body as a sensor
              right in front of the player. This then collides with everything around it but only registers if the box happens
              to collide with enemies.

              <p>
                Before I began the project I had never used the box2D framework before. so there was a large learning curve to get this to
                work when I started with drawing sprite in the game the sprites would draw at their pixel coordinates there
                (x,y) on the screen. as box2D used meters in the world we had to convert from pixels to meters. I developed
                this code below to convert my box2d code to work with pixel coordinates. this code takes the positions of
                the b2vec2 (x,y) it then uses those coordinates to get the other coordinates for the sides of the box and
                multiplies them by 30 (PTM) to get the location of the Body in the pixel coordinates.

              <p>
                Another feature that I wanted to employ was only being able to jump when touching certain items. For example, you cannot jump
                off the enemies as you should be taking damage from them. later in the game, I would like to apply double
                height jumps from some platforms to allow you to get to the next. below you will see my first attempt at
                deploying this. at first, I made a sensor that fixed to the bottom of the players Box2d Box that would count
                how many things it was touching and if that was greater than 2 you could jump. so, if you were touching a
                platform it allowed you to jump. this worked well as I was able to jump when touching the platform and
                not when I was in the jump animation. this also came with an unexpected benefit. with this code, I was able
                to move quite freely across the platform and even though there where mini jumps that were happening when
                the player moved (this happens because of friction) as the sensor was still touching the platform I could
                still jump.

              </div>
              <p>
                When using this code, it worked well until I realised that I could jump off the enemies as they would count as a fixture that
                the sensor this would also not allow me to reuse the code for future use or allow me to use the code to check
                if the object I was standing on could be a different fixture. I modified the code to use entity’s as the
                platforms the characters and the enemies are all entity’s this allows me to use the code for checking the
                platform for special platforms it will also be useful for future projects.
